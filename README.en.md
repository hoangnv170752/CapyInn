# CapyInn

Free, offline-first property management software for small hotels in Vietnam.

> Note: `CapyInn` is a clean-slate rename from `MHM`. Current builds use the new runtime root at `~/CapyInn` and do not auto-migrate legacy local data from `~/MHM`.

## What It Does

- first-run onboarding for hotel setup and room generation
- room dashboard for a configurable property layout
- Vietnamese ID card OCR with local processing
- check-in and check-out flows
- pricing, folio, and debt tracking
- revenue and expense analytics
- housekeeping workflow
- reservations and night audit

## Stack

- Tauri 2
- Rust
- React 19
- TypeScript
- SQLite
- PaddleOCR via `ocr-rs`

## Repository Layout

- `mhm/` — core application
